        Welcome to my inital GitHub page for assignment 1.

        <h3>Personal Information</h3><br/>
        <strong>Name: </strong> John Rehill<br/>
        <strong>Student Number: </strong> S3828158<br/>
        <strong>Email Address: </strong>s3828158@Student.rmit edu au<br/>
        <strong>Background: </strong><br/>
        <p>
            If anyone has heard me in person or over an online web session they would have heard my accent. I was born and raised in Ireland many years ago however I moved to Australia a number of years ago. I still strongly identify as Irish but walk the fine line of being a person of two cultures however I am lucky in that they are similar so it's not too much effort :-). <br/>
            Almost out of high school/senior school, I went to work and while I self taught some things and did some minor courses, I'm not doing a Bachelor of Information Technology via Open University/RMIT in order to formal get a a qualification and fill in the gaps in my knowledge. The first thing I'm beginning to learn is all about <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, as although I self taught HTML years ago (as you can see from my 'plain-jane' site) I never fully got into coding although it's always been a background passion for me.</p>
            <p>I naturally speak English but due to my education I can find my way around Irish and French but purely in a basic naming of objects sense or to know where modern words may have originated from. I think the Irish background is probably the thing people notice and remember about me as I spent all my formative years in Ireland so have a strong accent.

        <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
        <p>
         While growing up I was always tinkering with something electronic and playing games and while helping my day fix a VCR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder">Wikipedia article</a> for those that may not have heard of these) he mentioned that I should look into doing something with computers as I appeared to work with technology quite easily. So that's what I did.<br/>
         I was one of the first few in my school class to have a computer and was able to know enough that I became sort of a teachers assistant in computer class that I was asked to instruct some other students so lesson work would move smoother. With some work experience I spent some time at a local Universtity in the technology department and a remark by a lecturer pushed me to learn HMTL 4.0.<br/>
         After school I started doing a programming course but a chance encounter with a friend of a friend moved me into the hardware stream rather than software. From there I moved through life, picking up knowledge and skills and met an Australian girl while setting up an office with all their equipment. This prompted me to moved to Australia and stick with IT work which is what I'm still doing.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>I picked up some qualifications here and there but nothing of any major degree or recent so that's why I decided to sign up to OUA and go with RMIT to improve myself and see where my life can now go. I've only ever done class based courses or at least class based courses with one or two modules as online so this will be my first full online course. It's scary but I'm sure I can do it!
        </p>
        <p>One of the main things I want to improve upon is my knowledge of code and programming. I can usually pick apart a config file or script written in powershell or a batch file but if I had to create something major I'd be lost. Even with this page, I started using the HMTL code that I learnt years ago but found out that a lot of the code I know is now supreseded by CSS, of which I heard but I've never had to use. So I'm looking forward to this aspect of the course by far.
        </p>
        <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
        <p>An example of an Ideal job for me would be a Software Developer such as this <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/40504730?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=6242dde0-eb6d-45a1-a3f6-d7eb6b48f27e">.NET Developer</a>. Just in case the link is no longer available, here is a screenshot<br>
        <img src=".\images\job.png" alt="My ideal job"><br/>
        The job is for a software developer using .NET development code and also other web code. The use of the web code such as ASP.NET and C# is something I've always been interesting and learning more about.<br>
        This person doing this job would have worked in software development for many years and have a deep knowledge of coding. This job also mentions the use of Git which is something I'm just learning also.<br>
        While I've dealt with IIS and web site configuration files over the years, I only have enough knowledge to do a basic html text page and display some graphics or have some embedded video. I only know basic HTML and when getting into stuff such as CSS and Javascript, I have no idea.<br>
        With the knowledge I gain on this course I hope to be better able to use CSS and Javascript in order to better diagnose issues with web pages but also start to learn C#, Pearl or another programming language so that I can use packages such as Visual Studio code to develop my own websites or use packages written in these languages in web hosted solutions.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
        As part of my assessment I took an online Myers-Briggs test from <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com">Human Metrics</a><br/>
        The result is that I am a ISTJ<br/>
        <img src=".\images\MBT.png" style="width:506px;height:194px;" alt="Myers-Briggs result"><br/>
        I also took an online learning style test from <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com">How To Study</a><br/>
        The result is that my learning style is more VISUAL<br/>
        <img src=".\images\learn-style.png" style="width:483px;height:153px;" alt="Learing style"><br/>
        I then took a test on <a href="https://www.truity.com">Truity</a> for the big five personality test.
        The results are:<br/>
        <img src=".\images\big-5.png" style=width:375px;height:225px; alt="Big 5 result">
        <p>To me the results are not surpising. I'm quite an introverted person but I am working hard to change that. These tests show me to be a logical person which is reasonable since I worked in the IT field. I'm also a visual learner in that I learn by doing. While I do enjoy reading books on how to do things, I find that if I'm actually doing what is being taught or can see something happening rather than just reading about it, it tends to sink in better. I like to work alone but if needed to work in a team I will and try to be a good worker in the team. I'm not a leader type by nature but I can step up and guide if needed on certain matters.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Idea</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong><br/>
        The concept for this project centres around using a Raspberry Pi connected to a heat sensor that will turn on the air conditioner when a pre-determined temperature is reached. When activation occurs an email and/or text message can also be sent to a nominated contact. The targeted user would be the elderly or disabled who still live in their own homes in Australia, as having their air conditioning turn on automatically would assist in preventing them over-heating and the message sent to the nominee contact, will remind get in contact with the person to check on their well-being.</p>
        <p><strong>Motivation</strong><br/>
        The care of the independently living elderly and disabled in Australia should be of high priority in summer due to the intense heat caused by climate change, as temperatures are expected to increase in future years as detailed by a report published by <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature">Climate.gov</a><br/>
        <p>Since Australian summers do get quite hot, people will often leave it until the last minute to turn on their air conditioning. Leaving it until a room it feels uncomfortably warm increases the probability of an elderly or disabled person putting their health or life in jeopardy. </p>
        <p><strong>Issues</strong><br/>
        Should the Raspberry Pi have a software or hardware failure or the device loses power and the air conditioner does not turn on this can be countered by incorporating a &apos;Deadman&apos; alert and &apos;all clear&apos; alert.<br/>
        In addition to the &apos;Deadman&apos;/&apos;all clear&apos; alert it could be set up that the Pi would send a message at a pre-determined regular time to inform the nominated contact that the system is functioning correctly. If a message is missed, it will be a sign to check the system. </p>
        <p>There would also be the issue of cost of running an air conditioner. Many people may not wish to have air conditioning enabled by an automatic system due to concerns over cost of electricity. So to counter this the use of solar technology would be a suggested requirement.</p>  
        <p>The idea of home automation might be perceived by some people as enabling laziness, but used in the right way it can be of huge benefit. For example, for someone who may have mobility issues, the automatic nature of the device to turn on the air conditioner would be a benefit to their well-being and health, as well as a source of comfort for family members who may worry about their elderly parents or disabled family member. It could also be useful to integrate with other technology such as a virtual assistant such as Google Assistant, Apple Siri, or Amazon Alexia. </p>
        If the system works as expected for a hot summer, the system could then be adapted to also work in winter to enable the heat to be turned on. Due to the small cost of the Raspberry Pi and the free nature of the Linux operating system, additional units could be used in multiple locations in a home to detect where hot or cold spots are and only enable the heating or air conditioning in those rooms that require it. This is also where the use of wireless would be of benefit as the devices with the sensors could be relocated if required. <br/>
        <p><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong><br/>
        A Raspberry Pi is a small single board computer that can be expanded with the use of peripherals or modules to enable extended functionality. The main circuit board can be housed in various models of container boxes. The Pi runs on a Linux based operating system. There are non-Linux based alternatives for the Pi, even a Windows based variant called Windows 10 IoT Core, with IoT standing for 'Internet of Things'. Use of the Linux based system would ensure that support is easily available as the Raspberry Pi has a strong following in the Linux based community and therefore functionality could be expanded or development assisted.</p>
        <p>Raspberry Pi devices can operate via a wired or wireless connection. While wireless connection enables better setup and placement, this can also be a point of failure. A wired connection tends to be more reliable but the need to have a long cable running to devices would not be practical in a lot of situations. The air conditioning unit installed in the home should also be compatible with wireless option. Supplement to this idea would be the use of assistant enabled power points to also allow the use of this technology with pedestal or desk fans. It all ties into the idea of a smart home technology however the use of a Raspberry Pi with its heat sensor would make it all automatic.</p>
        <p>The heat sensor itself is not integrated with the Raspberry Pi in its basic form so a separate module unit will need to resourced and integrated. The variant of this model would need to be investigated to see which offers the most cost-effective solution to obtain and allows for ease of programming with the Raspberry Pi operating system.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome</strong><br/>
        The outcome of this technology would be a reduction in the cases of heat related deaths of the independently living elderly or disabled people. This technology would also provide peace of mind for family members.</p>
