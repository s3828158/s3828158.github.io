        <h3>Personal Information</h3><br/>
        <b>Name: </b> John Rehill<br/>
        <b>Student Number: </b> S3828158<br/>
        <b>Email Address: </b>s3828158@Student.rmit edu au<br/>
        <b>Background: </b><br/>
        <p>
            If anyone has heard me in person or over an online web session they would have heard my accent. I was born and raised in Ireland many years ago however I moved to Australia a number of years ago. I still strongly identify as Irish but walk the fine line of being a person of two cultures however I am lucky in that they are similar so it's not too much effort :-). <br/>
            Almost out of high school/senior school, I went to work and while I self taught some things and did some minor courses, I'm not doing a Bachelor of Information Technology via Open University/RMIT in order to formal get a a qualification and fill in the gaps in my knowledge. The first thing I'm beginning to learn is all about <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, as although I self taught HTML years ago (as you can see from my 'plain-jane' site) I never fully got into coding although it's always been a background passion for me.<br/>
            I naturally speak English but due to my education I can find my way around Irish and French but purely in a basic naming of objects sense or to know where modern words may have originated from. I think the Irish background is probably the thing people notice and remember about me as I spent all my formative years in Ireland so have a strong accent.
        </p>
        <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
        <p>
         While growing up I was always tinkering with something electronic and playing games and while helping my day fix a VCR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder">Wikipedia article</a> for those that may not have heard of these) he mentioned that I should look into doing something with computers as I appeared to work with technology quite easily. So that's what I did.<br/>
         I was one of the first few in my school class to have a computer and was able to know enough that I became sort of a teachers assistant in computer class that I was asked to instruct some other students so lesson work would move smoother. With some work experience I spent some time at a local Universtity in the technology department and a remark by a lecturer pushed me to learn HMTL 4.0.<br/>
         After school I started doing a programming course but a chance encounter with a friend of a friend moved me into the hardware stream rather than software. From there I moved through life, picking up knowledge and skills and met an Australian girl while setting up an office with all their equipment. This prompted me to moved to Australia and stick with IT work which is what I'm still doing.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>I picked up some qualifications here and there but nothing of any major degree or recent so that's why I decided to sign up to OUA and go with RMIT to improve myself and see where my life can now go. I've only ever done class based courses or at least class based courses with one or two modules as online so this will be my first full online course. It's scary but I'm sure I can do it!
        </p>
        <p>One of the main things I want to improve upon is my knowledge of code and programming. I can usually pick apart a config file or script written in powershell or a batch file but if I had to create something major I'd be lost. Even with this page, I started using the HMTL code that I learnt years ago but found out that a lot of the code I know is now supreseded by CSS, of which I heard but I've never had to use. So I'm looking forward to this aspect of the course by far.
        </p>
        <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
        <p>An example of an Ideal job for me would be a Software Developer such as this <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/40504730?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=6242dde0-eb6d-45a1-a3f6-d7eb6b48f27e">.NET Developer</a>. Just in case the link is no longer available, a screenshot can be viewed by clicking <a href=".\images\job.png" target="_blank">this screenshot</a><br/>
        The job is for a software developer using .NET development code and also other web code. The use of the web code such as ASP.NET and C# is something I've always been interesting and learning more about.<br>
        This person doing this job would have worked in software development for many years and have a deep knowledge of coding. This job also mentions the use of Git which is something I'm just learning also.<br>
        While I've dealt with IIS and web site configuration files over the years, I only have enough knowledge to do a basic html text page and display some graphics or have some embedded video. I only know basic HTML and when getting into stuff such as CSS and Javascript, I have no idea.<br>
        With the knowledge I gain on this course I hope to be better able to use CSS and Javascript in order to better diagnose issues with web pages but also start to learn C#, Pearl or another programming language so that I can use packages such as Visual Studio code to develop my own websites or use packages written in these languages in web hosted solutions.

        <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
        As part of my assessment I took an online Myers-Briggs test from <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com">Human Metrics</a><br/>
        The result is that I am a ISTJ<br/>
        <img src=".\images\MBT.png" style="width:506px;height:194px;"><br/>
        I also took an online learning style test from <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com">How To Study</a><br/>
        The result is that my learning style is more VISUAL<br/>
        <img src=".\images\learn-style.png" style="width:483px;height:153px;"><br/>
        I then took a test on <a href="https://www.truity.com">Truity</a> for the big five personality test.
        The results are:<br/>
